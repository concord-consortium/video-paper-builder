  <h3>VideoPaper Builder<span class="reg">&reg;</span> &mdash; Capture Your Classroom's Context</h3>
  <p>VideoPaper Builder<span class="reg">&reg;</span> allows teachers to capture the context of their own classrooms. This type of educational support provides an opportunity for teachers to learn from and interact with video, based on situations they face with their own students on a daily basis. Teachers can focus on certain pedagogical strategies that were helpful and powerful learning situations or provide options for future opportunities that will better impact their teaching. Due to the secure nature of VideoPapers, teachers will be able to display dialogue surrounding their videos. This type of personal narrative and sharing prompts discussion and interactions from their colleagues, building a strong professional community of learners.</p>
