Important
- scrubber to set the timing for a section is broken (works in firefox)
- logging in on the top right is broken (haven't seen this in a while)
- uploaded images should be stored in S3
- look for broken images (these might cause errors on production)
- fix help pages so they are dynamic

The Move
- transfer database, and migrate
- transfer images to S3 and update any old urls to them

Nice To Have
- images in S3 should be restricted based on the paper permissions
- need to figure out the correct image magik configuration for the aws server, this is to shrink the uploaded images
- pencil icon to edit section doesn't have the correct mouse cursor
- see if we can remove prototype and then get rid of $ -> $j mapping
- clean up 'unshare' so it uses the built in rails UJS support
    it does use a javascript view, but it should also use a link_to :remote=>true
- check if editing works again in IE, there was a alert added to block editing in IE
