Important
- add configuration of kaltura.yml to littlechef
- exception notification is not configured correctly
- pencil icon to edit section doesn't have the correct mouse cursor
- close button on edit timings popup doesn't work (and doesn't have a mouse cursor)
- scrubber to set the timing for a section is broken
- logging in on the top right is broken (at least some times)
- need to figure out the correct image magik configuration for the aws server
- uploaded images should be stored on S3 and their access restricted
- need to get migrations working from scratch again, currently they will break because of devise migration helpers

Nice To Have
- see if we can remove prototype and then get rid of $ -> $j mapping
- clean up 'unshare' so it uses the built in rails UJS support
    it does use a javascript view, but it should also use a link_to :remote=>true
- check if editing works again in IE, there was a alert added to block editing in IE
